Page Functions:

Now, the sidebar navigation is no longer navigating to the pages (views) when you click on any of the sidebar options. Can you fix this, and add a very basic settings page [as a view, like the rest of the pages] that has basic options but no functionality, this doesn't need to function, it just has to visually demonstrate a settings page. Make sure the 'settings' tab on the sidebar navigates to this page. The webapp also has a login page that's created with an 'index.html' file that is in the parent folder to the files home.html is with, can you make it so clicking on the 'logout' button on the sidebar takes the user back to this page?

Can you now: Check through all of the files, make sure everything is accurate, functional, and professional, and ensure there are no redundancies or unnecessary code, as well as make sure the 'chat' selection in the navigation bar has an icon that fits the rest. Check for missing comments or areas where you can write succinct professional comments (that are simple and quickly explain all parts of each file, written from a developer's perspective). Provide a succinct, professional, and accurate description of what each 'page' within this webapp has as intended and possible functions.
